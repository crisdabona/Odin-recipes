    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The best lasagna is the homemade one. I don't know if I've ever mentioned it before, but lasagna is one of my favorite pasta dishes. Perhaps I learned to make lasagna before cannelloni for a reason, my mother loves it.</p>
    <p>This classic of cuisine is famous worldwide, not just in Italy. It's ideal for taking to work or school in a lunchbox and is sure to be a hit among the little ones at home. Don't go overboard with the quantity, one serving is enough. It's a quite complete recipe that will give you the energy to get through a full day.</p>
